We will use this repository to raise issues and discuss general information about COMP 426, as well as procedures, policies, tools, and other general concerns.

Other general information will be added to this repository as needed.

## Issues

1. Please create issues for general inquiries about the structure of this course.
2. Assignment-specific issues need to be created in the appropriate assignment starter code template repository.
3. Any assignment-specific issue created here will be transferred by one of the instructional staff to the appropriate repo.

## OFFICE HOURS FOR WEEK OF APRIL 25

***Please note that this schedule is different from the regular hours schedule***

***IMPORTANT:** Please create assignment issues BEFORE you come to office hours and place the link to your posted issue in MDH when you add yourself to the queue so that we can reference it immediately. This will help up to address helping you with the assignments much more efficiently and effectively.*

During the week of April 25, due to high demand, if you have not created an issue or posted a link to it when you add yourself to the queue in MDH, you will be asked to do so and returned to the queue while you do. Thank you for complying with this request.
